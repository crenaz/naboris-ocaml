Hey, I'm following this tutorial: 
[OCaml and the Web. Building a simple web app using OCamlâ€¦ | by Shawn McGinty | Medium](https://medium.com/@shawn.mcginty/ocaml-and-the-web-9c3a16fe90e6)

And in the text he says: 
"Note: These commands will later be wrapped by npm scripts making it much easier to run."

But then he says, check out localhost:9000 to see that it's up and running.  When I ran it, I got the following error:


```
[main][~/projects/ONLINE/GITHUB/naboris-ocaml]$ npm run dev

npm ERR! syscall open

[main][~/projects/ONLINE/GITHUB/naboris-ocaml]$ touch package.json
*[main][~/projects/ONLINE/GITHUB/naboris-ocaml]$ npm start
```

After this the project was able to run.
